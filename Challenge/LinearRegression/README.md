# Linear Regression Challenge
This code is the respond to video: [How to Make a Prediction - Intro to Deep Learning #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOppzHpvTiQ) created by Siraj Rabal on Youtube.

##Overview
In this code, **Linear Regression** is used on the dataset to calculate accuracy. Data is available on [Siraj's Github](https://github.com/llSourcell/linear_regression_demo). The challenge for this [video]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOppzHpvTiQ)) is to use scikit-learn to create a line of best fit for the included 'challenge_dataset'. Then, make a prediction for an existing data point and see how close it matches up to the actual value. Print out the error. You can use scikit-learn's documentation for more help. These weekly challenges are not related to the Udacity nanodegree projects, those are additional.

##Challenge

* The challenge for this video is to use scikit-learn to create a line of best fit for the included 'challenge_dataset'. Then, make a prediction for an existing data point and see how close it matches up to the actual value. Print out the error you get. You can use scikit-learn's [documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html) for more help.

* Bonus points if you perform linear regression on a dataset with 3 different variables.

##Code
Implementation is been done in python using Jupyter. Libraries used here are:
* pandas 
* numpy
* sklearn
* matplotlib

Source code can be [found here](https://github.com/amanullahtariq/MLAlgorithm/blob/master/linear_regression_demo/Challenge.ipynb). 


##Requirements
* [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/install.html)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)

### Who do I talk to? ###
I would be happy to talk to you about this project and if you are interested then we can further enhance this project to.
