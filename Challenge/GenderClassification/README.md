# Gender Classification Challenge
## Overview

This is the code for the gender classification challenge for 'Learn Python for Data Science #1' by @Sirajology on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/T5pRlIbr6gg). The code uses the [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) machine learning library to train a [decision tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree) on a small dataset of body metrics (height, width, and shoe size) labeled male or female. Then we can predict the gender of someone given a novel set of body metrics. 

## Dependencies

* [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
* numpy (pip install numpy)
* matplotlib (pip install matplotlib)
* [IJupyter](http://jupyter.org/)

## Usage

In order to view the result just open **Classification.ipynb** in the browser (recomended Chrome). You can view all the code and result in the browser. 
To run the project you need [IJupyter](http://jupyter.org/) install.  After installation open command prompt or terminal and change path to your workspace and after that run IJupyter notebook
```
jupyter notebook
```

After, that open following path in the browser
```
http://localhost:8888/
```
Now, first download **Classification.ipynb** file and then upload **Classification.ipynb** file in your notebook and start playing with it.

## Challenge

Find 3 more classifiers from the sci-kit learn [documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_classifier_comparison.html) and add them to the demo.py code. Train them on the same dataset and [compare their results](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score.html). You can determine accuracy by trying to predict testing you trained classifier on samples from the training data and see if it correctly classifies it. Push your code repository to [github](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) then post it in the comments. I'll give the winner a shoutout a week from now!

###Who do I talk to? ###
I would be happy to talk to you about this project and if you are interested then we can further enhance this project to.
