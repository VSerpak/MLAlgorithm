# Machine learning Algorithms
If you are new to Machine learning please check out the reference section to dive deeper in to this field.

## Introduction ##
Implmentation some basic machine learning algorithms. All of these algorithms are implemented after taking courses in University of Freiburg and also after taking online courses about the ML algorithms.

## Methods #
* [Decision Tree] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning)
This code is implementation of the google lecture on the machine which can be [found here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKxRvEZd3Mw)

## How do I get set up? ##
This code is written in python using [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/install.html)
* First setting up and  how to use jupyther you can use this [Link] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsXXlYVBt1M)
