# Machine learning Example #

## Introduction ##
Implmentation some basic machine learning algorithms. All of these algorithms are implemented after taking classes in University of Freiburg or after taking online courses to get the deeper knowledge about the algorithms.

## Methods #
* [Decision Tree] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning)
This code is implementation of the google lecture on the machine which can be [found here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKxRvEZd3Mw)

### How do I get set up? ###
This code is written in python using [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/install.html)
* First install jupyter and then open notebook to run the example

### Who do I talk to? ###
I would be happy to talk to you about this project and if you are interested then we can further enhance this project to.
